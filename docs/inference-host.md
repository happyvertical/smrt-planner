# Inference modes and the host wire contract

The planner's assistant needs a language model. Where it runs is chosen at
runtime, so one build serves every deployment.

## Config: `planner.config.json`

Served at `${base}/planner.config.json` (next to the app; `base` is the
SvelteKit base path) and fetched once at startup. A missing file means the
defaults. A mounted `Planner` can pass the same object as its `inference` prop
(plus `onReply`); the prop overrides the file.

```json
{
  "inference": {
    "mode": "browser | host | byo",
    "host": { "endpoint": "/api/planner/chat" },
    "byo": { "presets": ["ollama", "openrouter", "openai", "custom"] }
  }
}
```

- `mode` defaults to `browser`.
- `host.endpoint` is required for `host`: an `http(s)://` URL, or a path on the
  page's own origin. A cross-origin endpoint must answer CORS (see below).
- `byo.presets` is optional. Entries are built-in ids (`ollama`, `openrouter`,
  `openai`, `custom`) or full definitions
  `{ id, label, baseUrl, model?, keyless?, cors? }`. Default: all four.
- `kitchen` (a sibling of `inference`, optional) is set by `smrt kitchen`:
  `{ "endpoint": "/api/kitchen/cookbook" }`. With it the export panel shows
  **Send to kitchen** (Download stays as the secondary option) once the page
  also holds the one-time token, which is **never in this file**; see "Send to
  kitchen" below. A `token` in the file is ignored. Unusable values are ignored.
- Anything invalid (bad JSON, unknown mode, `host` without a usable endpoint,
  malformed presets) falls back to `browser` and shows a visible notice on the
  AI page. A 404 or an HTML fallback page is "no file", with no notice.

| Mode | Where the model runs | Setup | Hear / Speak |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `browser` | WebLLM in a worker (WebGPU) | download on the AI page | in browser |
| `host` | the host's server | none | in browser |
| `byo` | the visitor's OpenAI-compatible endpoint | AI page: preset, model, key, Test connection | in browser |

The Think indicator reads "In browser", "Server" or "Your model: <name>".

## Host mode wire contract (version 1)

The server owns the prompt. The client never sends the planner's system prompt
or response schema.

### Request

`POST <endpoint>`, `content-type: application/json`, `accept: application/json`.
Same-origin cookies are sent (the fetch default); the planner adds no
Authorization header.

```json
{
  "version": 1,
  "message": "I run a bakery",
  "snapshot": { "version": 1, "revision": 4, "recipes": [], "...": "..." },
  "history": [
    { "role": "user", "content": "..." },
    { "role": "assistant", "content": "..." }
  ]
}
```

- `message`: the visitor's text, at most 2000 characters.
- `snapshot`: the controller's compact `PlanSnapshot` (`./commands`, about 2.6
  to 4.8 KB): recipes, features, settings, theme, sections, focus, undo.
- `history`: optional, oldest first, at most 6 entries of at most 1000
  characters, roles `user` and `assistant` only (never `system`).
- The client gives up after 60 s. Cancelling a turn aborts the request.

### Response

`200` with a JSON object, the same turn shape the assistant reads from a model.
Every field but `reply` is optional:

```json
{
  "reply": "Added Sales and Invoicing.",
  "add": ["commerce.sales"],
  "remove": [],
  "settings": { "currency": "CAD", "taxRate": 13, "paymentTerms": "Net 30" },
  "theme": { "preset": "glass", "primary": "#00aa77", "colorScheme": "dark" },
  "commands": [
    { "name": "add_recipes", "input": { "ids": ["commerce.sales"] } }
  ]
}
```

- `reply`: the sentence shown (and read aloud when Speak is on), about 200
  characters at most.
- `add` / `remove`: recipe ids; unknown ids are dropped client-side.
- `settings.taxRate` is in percent. `theme` is tokens only, never CSS.
- `commands`: up to 8 planner commands (`commandTools` / `commandSchemas` in
  `./commands`), run in order through the controller, which validates each.
  The first refused one stops the rest and is reported in the chat. They apply
  only in host mode; a browser or bring-your-own model's `commands` are ignored.
- A non-JSON body is shown as the reply text. A non-2xx status shows "the model
  could not answer: the server answered <status>".
- Streaming is not part of version 1. A later version may add
  `accept: text/event-stream` with the same object as the final event; a server
  that ignores it and answers JSON stays valid.

CORS, for a cross-origin endpoint: allow the page's origin, methods `POST` and
`OPTIONS`, and header `content-type`.

### Stub

`tests/inference-host.test.ts` runs the client against a real HTTP stub server
(`tests/stub-server.ts`); copy it as a conformance starting point.

## Bring-your-own mode

The AI page offers Ollama (`http://localhost:11434/v1`), OpenRouter, OpenAI and
a custom OpenAI-compatible address. Each has a model field and, except Ollama,
a key field, plus **Test connection** (one tiny completion that exercises the
address, the model and the key).

- The key is stored only in this browser: `localStorage` key
  `smrt-planner:inference-key:v1`, apart from the choices in
  `smrt-planner:inference:v1`. It is sent only as `Authorization: Bearer <key>`
  to the chosen address, never in a URL, a body, a message or a log.
- The client builds the planner prompt itself (as in browser mode) and POSTs
  `${baseUrl}/chat/completions` with `response_format` JSON mode: the planner's
  `json_schema`, stepping down to `json_object` and then plain text when the
  endpoint answers 400 or 422.
- Browser access (CORS) per preset:
  - **Ollama**: start it with `OLLAMA_ORIGINS` set to the site's origin (for
    example `OLLAMA_ORIGINS=https://example.com ollama serve`; on macOS
    `launchctl setenv OLLAMA_ORIGINS https://example.com`, then restart).
  - **OpenRouter** and **OpenAI**: calls from web pages are accepted. Use a
    key with a low spending limit; anyone with access to the browser profile
    can read it.
  - **Custom**: answer the preflight for the page's origin, headers
    `authorization` and `content-type`, methods `POST` and `OPTIONS`.
- `@happyvertical/ai` was checked first: its root entry wraps the Node-first
  `openai`, Anthropic and AWS SDKs, and its browser-safe `./local` entry only
  has the WebLLM provider, so the client is a single `fetch`
  (`src/lib/inference/openai.ts`).

## Implementing the host in Node: `@happyvertical/smrt-planner/core`

`./commands` is Svelte source and cannot be imported by plain Node. `./core` is
the rune-free part (including `createHeadlessPlanner`, the command set over a
plain-object plan: see below), compiled to plain JavaScript, with no Vite and no Svelte
compiler involved. It has everything a server needs to speak this contract:

| Export | Use |
| --- | --- |
| `parseHostRequest(body)` | check the POST body: `{ ok, request }` or `{ ok: false, error }` |
| `buildHostPrompt({ message, snapshot, history?, catalog? })` | `{ system, messages }` for one chat call |
| `replySchema` / `buildReplySchema(catalog?)` | JSON Schema of the model's answer (ids are enums) |
| `parseHostReply(text, catalog?)` | `{ ok, reply, issues }`; `reply` is the response body |
| `commandTools`, `commandSchemas`, `checkSchema` | the 21 commands as tool definitions |
| `createHeadlessPlanner(cookbook?, { catalog? })` | one plan in plain Node: `run`, `batch`, `snapshot`, `cookbook`, `undo`, `subscribe` |
| `recipes`, `libraryCookbooks`, `defaultCatalog` | the catalog the prompt is built from |
| `PlanSnapshot`, `CommandInputs`, `HostRequest`, `HostReply` ... | types |

`buildHostPrompt` is the browser assistant's own prompt (same wording and worked
examples, focused on the recipes the message matches, with the snapshot's
settings, theme and recipes) plus a host-only section naming the `commands` and
the menu ids. `system` is separate, so it fits both API styles: OpenAI-style,
send `[{ role: 'system', content: system }, ...messages]`; Anthropic-style, pass
`system` and `messages` as they are.

### Holding a plan: `createHeadlessPlanner`

```js
import { createHeadlessPlanner } from '@happyvertical/smrt-planner/core';

const plan = createHeadlessPlanner();           // or (cookbookDocument, { catalog })
plan.run({ name: 'add_cookbook', input: { id: 'bakery' } }); // { ok, snapshot, receipt }
plan.snapshot();   // the same PlanSnapshot the browser controller returns
plan.cookbook();   // the plan as a cookbook document
plan.undo();       // undo the latest undoable change
```

It is smrt's cookbook command engine (`createCookbookEngine` from
`@happyvertical/smrt-core/cookbook/engine`) behind the planner's names plus
`focus`, which moves the planner's view and not the document. The commands,
input schemas, validation, error codes and receipts are the engine's: the
browser controller is the same adapter over the app's stores, and the parity
test runs one script through the browser controller, the headless planner and
a bare engine. State is a plain object, so any number of plans may coexist in
one process. It keeps no sample records, and a document's `overviews` (page
customisations) are dropped with a notice, because checking them needs
smrt-svelte's widget registry, which loads Svelte components. `catalog` limits
the recipe and cookbook ids a plan accepts. `plan.batch({ id?, commands })`
runs up to 50 commands all or nothing.

## Commands: what the engine changed

The planner's command set shipped as 19 commands with its own runner. Since
smrt 0.55.11 it is the engine's 20 plus `focus` (21). The names and input
schemas are unchanged unless listed here, so a host written against the old
set keeps working.

- **New**: `set_name` (name and describe the app) and `validate` (typed
  diagnostics, changes nothing). `batch` (atomic) and command `id`s (a
  repeated `id` returns the first result with `replayed: true`; the same `id`
  for a different command is `id_reuse`).
- **Commands carry `id` and `expectedRevision`**: `{ name, input, id?,
  expectedRevision? }`. The `run(command, { expectedRevision })` option still
  works.
- **Errors**: `unsupported` is gone (the engine always has every part of the
  app); `id_reuse` and `batch_failed` are new. `error` may carry `path` and
  `details`.
- **Receipts** gain `revisionBefore`, `revisionAfter`, `id` and `warnings`.
- **Undo is the whole document**, not one part of it. `apply_cookbook` and
  `import_cookbook` can now be undone (they had no undo). `undo` is a
  `conflict` while the plan differs from what that change left, unless
  `force: true`; the assistant's own theme Undo therefore never forces and falls
  back to putting the previous theme back, leaving later edits alone.
- **A manual edit in the app** (a store changed by the UI, not by a command)
  is adopted on the next call: the revision moves by one, and the undo ids
  issued before it answer `not_found`. Page customisations (`overviews`) are
  edited outside the plan and do not move the revision.
- **Snapshot**: `app.description` is new; everything else, `focus` included, is
  as before. Equal histories give equal revisions, and a command that changes
  nothing does not move it.
- **`import_cookbook`** runs the planner's own strict check first (its
  wording, old-id migration, page-customisation check) and then the engine's;
  the code and `path` of a refusal are the engine's.
- **Library cookbook with no theme** keeps the person's own look, in the same
  undoable step (a batch of `apply_cookbook` and `set_theme`).
- `@happyvertical/smrt-core` is now a runtime dependency of the package
  (it was a dev dependency); `./core` imports its engine entry.

### Minimal reference server

Any OpenAI-compatible endpoint works (`BASE_URL` such as
`http://localhost:11434/v1` for Ollama, `MODEL` its model name):

```js
import { createServer } from 'node:http';
import { buildHostPrompt, parseHostReply, parseHostRequest, replySchema }
  from '@happyvertical/smrt-planner/core';

const { BASE_URL, MODEL, API_KEY = '' } = process.env;

async function chat(req) {
  const { system, messages } = buildHostPrompt(req);
  const res = await fetch(`${BASE_URL}/chat/completions`, {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: { 'content-type': 'application/json', authorization: `Bearer ${API_KEY}` },
    body: JSON.stringify({
      model: MODEL,
      temperature: 0,
      messages: [{ role: 'system', content: system }, ...messages],
      response_format: { type: 'json_schema', json_schema: { name: 'turn', schema: replySchema } },
    }),
  });
  if (!res.ok) throw new Error(`model answered ${res.status}`);
  return (await res.json()).choices[0].message.content;
}

createServer(async (req, res) => {
  if (req.method !== 'POST' || req.url !== '/api/planner/chat') {
    return res.writeHead(404).end();
  }
  let body = '';
  for await (const part of req) body += part;
  let parsed;
  try { parsed = parseHostRequest(JSON.parse(body)); } catch { parsed = { ok: false, error: 'bad JSON' }; }
  if (!parsed.ok) return res.writeHead(400).end(parsed.error);
  try {
    const { reply, issues } = parseHostReply(await chat(parsed.request));
    if (issues.length) console.warn('planner reply:', issues);
    res.writeHead(200, { 'content-type': 'application/json' }).end(JSON.stringify(reply));
  } catch (error) {
    console.error(error);
    res.writeHead(502).end();
  }
}).listen(8787);
```

A model without `json_schema` support: drop `response_format` or use
`{ type: 'json_object' }`; `parseHostReply` still repairs prose, cut-off JSON
and unknown ids.

### Serving the planner app: `@happyvertical/smrt-planner/app`

`pnpm package` also builds the prerendered static app into the package's
`app/` directory. `appDir` from `@happyvertical/smrt-planner/app` is its absolute path (Node
only; `appFile('x')` resolves one file in it). The files are also addressable as
`smrt-planner/app/*`.

```js
import { appDir } from '@happyvertical/smrt-planner/app';
// serve appDir at `/` or at `/planner`; for example with sirv, express.static or serve-static
```

- **Base path.** The app is built with SvelteKit's relative paths: every asset
  and link in each prerendered page is relative, and the page works out its base
  from `location` in the browser. The same files serve at `/`, at `/planner/`
  or anywhere else, with no rebuild or setting. Serve `index.html` for
  directories (every route is `<dir>/index.html`, trailing slash always) and
  redirect `/planner` to `/planner/`.
- **`404.html`** is the SPA fallback for paths that were not prerendered; it is
  built for base `/`, so at a sub-path serve it only if you built from source
  with `BASE_PATH=/planner pnpm build`, or answer unknown paths with `404`.
- **Config.** The app fetches `<base>/planner.config.json` at startup. Answer
  that one path yourself (or copy `appDir` to a writable directory and add the
  file) to choose the inference mode:

  ```json
  { "inference": { "mode": "host", "host": { "endpoint": "/api/planner/chat" } } }
  ```

  `endpoint` is a path on the page's own origin, so it is the same whatever the
  base is. Without the file the app runs in `browser` mode.
- The directory is about 70 MB (the on-device model runtime is most of it);
  serve it with compression and long-lived caching for `_app/immutable/`.

## Send to kitchen

`smrt kitchen` (the `smrt` CLI) serves this app on `127.0.0.1`, answers the host
contract above with the user's own AI provider, and announces itself with the
`kitchen` block of `planner.config.json` (the endpoint only). The page then
`POST`s the cookbook:

- `POST <endpoint>`, `content-type: application/json`, header
  `x-kitchen-token: <token>`, body = the cookbook JSON (`cookbook/v1`).
- `200 { "ok": true, "dir", "mode": "new" | "update", "installed", "added": [package names], "nextSteps": [commands] }`:
  the project was written. The CLI prints the same steps and exits.
- `4xx/5xx { "ok": false, "errors": [...] }`: nothing was applied; the CLI keeps
  listening, so the visitor can change the cookbook and send again.

### The token travels in the address fragment

The one-time token is **not in `planner.config.json`** (any local process that
sends the server's `Host` header could read it there). `smrt kitchen` opens and
prints

    http://127.0.0.1:<port>/#kitchen=<token>

A fragment is never sent to a server, so no endpoint can serve it. The page:

1. reads `location.hash` once, at startup, before the first URL rewrite
   (`readKitchenFragment`, `src/lib/kitchen/fragment.ts`; the token must be
   1 to 256 URL-safe characters, `A-Z a-z 0-9 . _ ~ -`, anything else is dropped);
2. keeps it in memory only (`kitchenState`): not in `localStorage`, not in the
   cookbook, not in any URL, and in no request but the cookbook POST's
   `x-kitchen-token` header;
3. removes the `kitchen` parameter from the address with `replaceState`
   (other fragment parameters stay), so it is not in the history entry either.

Opening the page without the fragment, or reloading after it was removed, leaves
the page with no token: the export panel says so ("Send to kitchen needs its
link") and offers Download. Reopen the address `smrt kitchen` printed.

The client is `src/lib/kitchen/client.ts` (`sendToKitchen`); the panel reads
`kitchenState`. Change the contract here and in the CLI's
`packages/cli/agents/kitchen.md` together.
